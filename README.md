## Requirements

This module requires **webtrees** version 2.2 or later.
This module has the same requirements as [webtrees system requirements](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees#system-requirements).

This module was tested with **webtrees** 2.2.1 and later versions.

### Telegram Bot:
- Create a Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token).
- Obtain your bot's token and chat ID.

### Cron Job:
To ensure that the notifications are sent regularly (e.g., daily at midnight), you need to set up a **cron job** on your server. The link for the cron must be taken from the module settings. This will allow the script to check for events and send the corresponding notifications.
